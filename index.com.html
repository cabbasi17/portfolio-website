                <h3>Swift Task</h3>
                <p>   The Problem: 
                  Too many things to keep track of. High school and college are busy times for students. Between work and class, students can easily miss assignments and deadlines if they are not keeping track of them. 
                  
                  The Solution: 
                  A peaceful, organized, simple productivity app.</p>

                <h3>Flourish App</h3>
                <p>This app is for every single person who wants to be healthy and keep track of their mind, body,
                  and soul health. People often use separate apps for physical health, mental well-being, and
                  spiritual growth, leading to a disjointed experience. This app integrates body, mind, and spirit
                  practices into one cohesive platform, providing a holistic approach to wellness. I am designing
                  for young adults (22-35), students (18-25), Millennial and gen z wellness enthusiasts (20-40).       This app is for every single person who wants to be healthy and keep track of their mind, body,
