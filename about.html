        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Cienna! I’m a UI designer with a unique background in early childhood special education. Over the years, I developed a deep sense of empathy, patience, and creativity while working with children with diverse abilities. These experiences have not only shaped my approach to design but have also given me valuable skills in organization and problem-solving.</p>

        <p>Transitioning into UI design felt like a natural evolution for me. The same principles I applied in education—understanding different learning styles, simplifying complex concepts, and building supportive environments—are all vital to creating intuitive, user-friendly digital experiences.</p>

        <p>My experience has taught me that great design doesn’t just look good—it works for the people who use it. I strive to create designs that not only meet functional requirements but also enhance the overall user journey. Whether it’s optimizing a website for screen readers or simplifying navigation, my goal is to create seamless, engaging experiences.</p>

        <p>Outside of work, I’m an avid traveler and adventurer. Growing up in different countries has given me a unique perspective on the world and a deep appreciation for diverse cultures. I find inspiration in every journey, whether I’m hiking through nature or exploring new cities.</p>
